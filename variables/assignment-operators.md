# Assignment Operators

In osl you can use an assignment operator to set a variable to itself but modified by an operator. This allows you to compact code into a simpler format.&#x20;

An example of an assignment operator is `+=` where it adds/joins a value to the variable

```javascript
variable = 10
// the variable is 10

variable += 10
// the variable is now 20
```

## All Assignment operators

```javascript
variable += number
// adds a number to the variable value

variable += string
// joins a string to the variable value

variable -= number
// subtracts a number from the variable value

variable /= number
// divides the variable value by a number

variable *= number
// multiplies the variable value by a number

variable %= number
// sets the varable value to "variable % number"

variable ^= number
// sets the varable value to "variable ^ number"
```
