# .some(callback)

## Description

The `some` method tests whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided callback function. It returns a Boolean value.

## Parameters

The `some` method requires the array to test and the custom function that defines the test for each element.

## Usage On Arrays

In the provided examples, the `some` method is used to check if at least one element in the array `num`, which contains the numbers `[1,2,3,4,5]`, is greater than 3.

* A separate function `isGreaterThanThree` is defined using the syntax `def isGreaterThanThree(item)`.
* Inside the function, `item > 3` is returned, which checks if each item is greater than 3.
* `num.some(isGreaterThanThree)` is called, applying the `isGreaterThanThree` function to each element, resulting in `true` since some elements are greater than 3.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```javascript
num = [1,2,3,4,5]

def isGreaterThanThree(item) (
  return item > 3
)

log num.some(isGreaterThanThree)
// true
```
{% endcode %}

## Inline Functions

The `some` method can also be used with inline functions. In the example below, the `some` method is used to check if at least one element in the array `num` is greater than 3.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```javascript
num = [1,2,3,4,5]

log num.some(def(item) -> (
  return item > 3
))
// true
```
{% endcode %}

## Lambda Functions

The `some` method can also be used with lambda functions. In the example below, the `some` method is used to check if at least one element in the array `num` is greater than 3.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```javascript
num = [1,2,3,4,5]

log num.some(item -> (item > 3))
// true
```
{% endcode %}
