# .getAsync()

## Description

getAsync tries to download content from the internet. While it hasn't finished downloading, it will return "Loading". This is much better than the [.httpget.md](.httpget.md "mention") method since it will not pause the execution of your app or your ui in order to make a web request at the expense of being more complex to handle and setup.

## Parameters

getAsync takes no parameters

## Usage

```javascript
// handling an asyncronous download

downloaded = false
// setup the variable to store if the download is done
mainloop:

if downloaded.not (
    content = "url".getAsync()
    // set the content variable to the data from the asyncronous get request
    
    downloaded = content !== "Loading"
    // if the download completes, ie: is not "Loading" then downloaded becomes true
    // you can totally use an object to store the states of each asyncronous download
)
```
