# Mathematical Usage

## Add Numbers

You can use the simple `+` operator when you want to add two values together

```javascript
log 10 + 5
// does an addition on its two operands and returns 15
// this is doing 10 plus 5
```

## Minus Numbers

You can use the simple `-` operator when you want to minus two values from each other

```javascript
log 10 - 5
// does a subtraction on its two operands and returns 5
// this is doing 10 minus 5
```

## Divide Numbers

You can use the simple `/` operator when you want to divide two values by each other

```javascript
log 10 / 5
// does a division on its two operands and returns 2
// this is doing 10 divided by 5
```

## Multiply Numbers

You can use the simple `*` operator when you want to multiply two values by each other

```javascript
log 10 * 5
// does a multiplication on its two operands and returns 50
// this is doing 10 times 5
```

## Exponentiate Numbers

You can use the simple `^` operator when you want to exponentiate two values by each other

```javascript
log 10 ^ 2
// does an exponentiation on its two operands and returns 100
// this is doing 10 to the power of 2
```

## Modulo Numbers

You can use the simple `^` operator when you want to exponentiate two values by each other

```javascript
log 10 % 3
// does a division and returns the remainder of the division
// this is doing 10 / 3 and returning the remainder "1"
```
