# log value

In osl you can use the "log" command in the same way that the "print" function is used in python, or the "console.log" method is used in javascript. It simply logs a value to the console for you to read.&#x20;

Values from log, warn and error, all go to the browser's debug console.



```javascript
log "hello world"
// logs to the browser console
```
