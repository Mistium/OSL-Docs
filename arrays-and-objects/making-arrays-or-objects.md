# Making Arrays Or Objects

If you want a json editor, I suggest [https://www.jsonblob.com/](https://www.jsonblob.com/)

## Arrays

Arrays tend to follow the syntax shown below

```json
["value1","value2","value3","value4"]
```

Assigning an array

```javascript
arr = ["value1","value2","value3","value4"]
// on one line

// when assigning a multiline array, it requires that the value is "[" on the first line
arr = [
  "value1",
  "value2",
  "value3",
  "value4"
]
// or over multiple lines
```

Arrays can be used to store data in a list that can be accessed and updated by your program.
