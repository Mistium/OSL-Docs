# Making Arrays Or Objects

If you want a json editor, I suggest [https://www.jsonblob.com](https://www.jsonblob.com/) or [https://jsoncrack.com/editor](https://jsoncrack.com/editor)

## Arrays

Arrays tend to follow the syntax shown below

```json
["value1","value2","value3","value4"]
```

Assigning an array

```javascript
arr = ["value1","value2","value3","value4"]
// on one line

arr = [
  "value1",
  "value2",
  "value3",
  "value4"
]
// or over multiple lines
```

Arrays can be used to store data in a list that can be accessed and updated by your program.

<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="lang-javascript">num = 10

// you can also put variables and calculations in arrays
arr = [
  num,
<strong>  num + 1,
</strong>  num * 10
]
</code></pre>
